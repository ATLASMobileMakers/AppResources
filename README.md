#ATLAS Mobile Makers 

ATLAS Mobile Makers is a student group at the University of Colorado Boulder's ATLAS Institute aimed at bringing together people interested in app development. We have students of all experience levels, and no programming experience is necessary. You can be a designer, CS major, business major, or someone  who is just interested in app development to join!
Note: The 'week' folders in iOSTutorials and AndroidTutorials are from Aileen Pierce's ATLS4120 lectures at the University of Colorado Boulder.
